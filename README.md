## 🛠️ Implementation Process
1. Frequency Analysis
2. Heap Construction
3. Huffman Tree Building
4. Code Generation
5. Compression
6. Decompression

## 🚀 Usage
Compress: input.txt → input.cod + input.com

Decompress: input.com + input.cod → output.txt


## 🎓 Educational Value
This implementation demonstrates:
- Huffman coding algorithm
- Binary tree construction and traversal
- Heap data structure
- Bit manipulation
- File I/O operations
- Compression principles

## 💡 Tips for Use
- Test with files <4GB for meaningful compression
- Compare file sizes: input.txt input.com
- Verify decompression: diff input.txt input2.txt
- Try different text types (code, prose, repetitive data)
