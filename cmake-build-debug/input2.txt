# Huffman Text File Compressor

## 📌 Overview
This is a C++ implementation of a Huffman coding-based text file compression and decompression tool. It uses Huffman's algorithm to build an optimal prefix code for characters in a text file, compressing the file while maintaining lossless reconstruction.

## 🚀 Features
- Compression: Converts text files into compressed binary format (.com)

- Decompression: Reconstructs original text from compressed files

- Frequency Analysis: Displays character frequencies in the terminal

- Code Generation: Creates a code mapping file (.cod) for Huffman codes

- Menu-Driven Interface: User-friendly command-line interface
